# Leonardo's Prime Factors

Leonardo loves primes and created q queries where each query takes the form of an integer, n. For each n, he wants you to count the maximum number of unique prime factors of any number in the inclusive range [1, n]  and then print this value on a new line.

The first line contains an integer, q, denoting the number of queries. 
Each line i of the  subsequent lines contains a single integer, n.
